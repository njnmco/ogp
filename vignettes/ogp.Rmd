## Guiding Principles

From: https://www.lacountyarts.org/funding/organizational-grant-program/ogp-grantseekers/apply/ogp-grantseekers-calculator-explained

```
Working with a professional statistician, the following principles were used to guide the formula creation in 2013:

The solution should eliminate any discontinuous penalties for growth
The solution should continue to allow smaller organizations to request and receive a greater proportion of their overall budget than the larger organizations
The solution should minimize the number of contracts whose maximum grant allocation shifts up or down by more than 25% of the 2013/2014 levels
The solution should take particular care with the smaller contracts in the OGP I and OGP II categories, for whom small changes in grant allocations create significant difficulties
The solution could be in the form of a calculator on the Arts and Culture website
The solution need not take into account the current OGP categories
```

## Project Category

  * _Sustainability_: Provides support for existing artistic and/or administrative projects that help to sustain the mission and goals of arts organizations.
  * _Organizational Capacity_: Provides support for new projects that increase the organizational capacity and infrastructure of arts organizations.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
